These are my best (in reasonable time) efforts to join the Advent of Code challanges. Instead of going as fast as possible in the least amount of lines, I'll try to challange myself with these two concepts:

> Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.
> *Martin Fowler, 2008*

> Performance is a feature
